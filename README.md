# SudokuSolver
This project can take a sudoku puzzle through a text file and solve it.
The input must be through a "table.txt" file outside the src folder containing a 9x9 grid of numbers with a delimiting character in between each number. 
A 0 represents a number that needs to be solved. After taking in input, it will print out the unsolved and the solved puzzle. 
The time complexity of this puzzle is O(9^n) where n is the number of elements that need to be solved.
